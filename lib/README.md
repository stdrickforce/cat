### Message properties

* type

	Represents a category of message, like `SQL`, `RPC` or `HTTP`.

* name

	Represents a specified action, for example

	* If the **type** is `SQL`, the **name** may be `select <?> from user where id = <?>`, which is the base SQL.
	* If the **type** is `RPC`, the **name** may be `QueryOrderByUserId(string, int)`, which is the signature of an api.
	* If the **type** is `HTTP`, the **name** may be `/api/v8/{int}/orders`, which is the base uri.

   > Detailed information should be recorded in the **data** field, like the parameters of an api.

* status

	Represents the status of the message.

	The message will be treated as a "problem" if the status of it is not equal to "0", and will be shown in the problem report. Once a message has been treated as a "problem", whatever what type it is, the current message tree will not be aggregated, that means you can always get the structure of a "problemed" logview.

* data

	Record the detailed information about a message.

	* If the **type** is `SQL`, the **data** may be `id=75442432`
	* If the **type** is `RPC`, the **data** may be `userType=dianping&userId=9987`
	* If the **type** is `HTTP`, the **data** may be `orderId=75442432`

	`data` field may also contains `error stack trace` in some cases. (like represent an exception or an error)

* timestamp

	Represents the created time of the message.

	The number of **milliseconds** that have elapsed since `1970-01-01 00:00:00`

#### Transaction-only properties

* duration

	Represents the total time in **milliseconds** that a transaction costed.

	It is calculated while a transaction has been completed.

	> duration = currentTimestamp() - durationStart

* durationStart

	Represents the created time of a transaction.

	It can be different with `timestamp`, the `durationStart` is only used for calculating the `duration` of a transaction.
